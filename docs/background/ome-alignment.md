# OME (Open Microscopy Environment) and lambda-ber-schema Alignment

## Executive Summary

The Open Microscopy Environment (OME) provides established standards for biological imaging data, while lambda-ber-schema extends these concepts to structural biology techniques. This document outlines how lambda-ber-schema aligns with and complements OME standards, enabling interoperability between light/fluorescence microscopy and structural biology data.

## OME Overview

### What is OME?

The Open Microscopy Environment is a consortium developing open-source software and format standards for biological microscopy data. Established in 2005, OME has become the de facto standard for microscopy data management in the life sciences.

### Core Components

1. **OME Data Model**: A comprehensive specification for storing biological imaging data
2. **Bio-Formats**: Library translating 160+ proprietary formats into the common OME model
3. **OMERO**: Server platform for managing, visualizing, and analyzing microscopy data
4. **OME-TIFF**: Standard file format combining TIFF images with OME-XML metadata
5. **OME-NGFF**: Next-generation cloud-native formats (Zarr-based)

### OME Data Model Structure

The OME model centers around these key entities:

```
Image
├── Pixels (dimensional and type information)
│   ├── Channel (wavelength, fluorophore)
│   ├── Plane (2D slice with timing)
│   └── BinData/TiffData (raw pixel data)
├── Instrument (microscope configuration)
│   ├── Microscope
│   ├── Objective
│   ├── Detector
│   └── LightSource
├── Experiment (experimental context)
├── Experimenter (person metadata)
└── ROI (Regions of Interest)
    └── Shape (rectangles, polygons, etc.)
```

## lambda-ber-schema-OME Alignment

### Shared Concepts

lambda-ber-schema intentionally aligns with OME in several fundamental areas:

#### 1. Image-Centric Data Model

**OME Approach:**
- Images are first-class entities with rich metadata
- Hierarchical structure from Image → Pixels → Planes

**lambda-ber-schema Alignment:**
```yaml
Image (abstract base)
├── Image2D (micrographs, diffraction patterns)
├── Image3D (volumes, tomograms)
├── FluorescenceImage (OME-compatible fluorescence)
├── OpticalImage (brightfield, phase contrast)
├── FTIRImage (spectroscopy imaging)
└── XRFImage (elemental mapping)
```

#### 2. Instrument Metadata

**OME Model:**
```xml
<Instrument ID="Instrument:1">
  <Microscope Type="Inverted"/>
  <Objective ID="Objective:1" LensNA="1.4"/>
  <Detector Type="PMT"/>
</Instrument>
```

**lambda-ber-schema Parallel:**
```yaml
Instrument (abstract base)
├── CryoEMInstrument
│   ├── voltage: 300kV
│   ├── detector_type: direct_electron
│   └── pixel_size: 0.83Å
├── XRayInstrument
│   ├── source_type: synchrotron
│   └── wavelength: 0.97Å
└── SAXSInstrument
    ├── q_range: 0.01-4.0 Å⁻¹
    └── detector_type: hybrid_pixel
```

#### 3. Experimental Context

Both models capture:
- Experimenter information
- Acquisition parameters
- Sample preparation details
- Processing workflows

### Complementary Extensions

lambda-ber-schema extends OME concepts for structural biology:

#### 1. Multi-Technique Integration

While OME focuses on light microscopy, lambda-ber-schema adds:
- Cryo-EM specific parameters (defocus, CTF, particle picking)
- X-ray crystallography (space groups, unit cells, phasing)
- Small-angle scattering (Guinier analysis, P(r) distributions)
- Spectroscopy imaging (FTIR, XRF)

#### 2. Molecular Composition

lambda-ber-schema adds detailed biomolecular information:
```yaml
MolecularComposition:
  sequences: [amino acid/nucleotide sequences]
  modifications: [PTMs, chemical modifications]
  ligands: [bound cofactors, substrates]
```

OME typically handles this through structured annotations.

#### 3. Processing Workflows

lambda-ber-schema explicitly models computational workflows:
```yaml
WorkflowRun:
  workflow_type: refinement
  software_name: RELION
  processing_level: 3  # raw→processed→refined
```

OME uses AnalysisModule for similar purposes but with less domain specificity.

## Interoperability Strategies

### 1. Direct Mapping for Shared Concepts

| OME Entity | lambda-ber-schema Entity | Notes |
|------------|------------------|-------|
| Image | Image | Base class alignment |
| Pixels | Image2D/3D dimensions | Dimensional metadata |
| Channel | FluorescenceImage.excitation_wavelength | Spectral information |
| Instrument | Instrument | Polymorphic specialization |
| Experimenter | Study.principal_investigator | Personnel tracking |
| ROI | Not yet implemented | Future enhancement |

### 2. OME-Compatible Subclasses

lambda-ber-schema's `FluorescenceImage` and `OpticalImage` classes are designed to be OME-compatible:

```yaml
FluorescenceImage:
  excitation_wavelength: 488  # nm, maps to OME Channel
  emission_wavelength: 520    # nm
  fluorophore: "GFP"          # OME Fluor
  exposure_time: 100           # ms, OME Plane.ExposureTime
```

### 3. Bio-Formats Integration Points

lambda-ber-schema data can interface with Bio-Formats through:
- Standard image formats (TIFF, PNG, JPEG)
- OME-TIFF export for compatible image types
- Metadata translation layers

### 4. OMERO Compatibility

Structural biology images can be stored in OMERO with:
- Custom annotations for technique-specific metadata
- Tag-based organization for multi-technique studies
- Integration with existing OMERO analysis workflows

## Practical Integration Examples

### Example 1: Correlative Microscopy

Study combining fluorescence microscopy (OME) with cryo-EM (lambda-ber-schema):

```yaml
Study:
  images:
    - id: fluor-001
      _type: FluorescenceImage  # OME-compatible
      file_name: "cells_gfp.ome.tiff"
      excitation_wavelength: 488
      emission_wavelength: 520
      
    - id: cryoem-001
      _type: Image2D  # lambda-ber-schema cryo-EM
      file_name: "micrograph_001.mrc"
      defocus: -2.5
      pixel_size: 1.06
```

### Example 2: Multi-Scale Imaging

Linking OME light microscopy with lambda-ber-schema X-ray imaging:

```yaml
images:
  - id: optical-overview
    _type: OpticalImage
    illumination_type: brightfield
    magnification: 10
    # Compatible with OME Objective.NominalMagnification
    
  - id: xrf-map
    _type: XRFImage  
    beam_energy: 12.4  # keV
    beam_size: 2.0     # μm
    # lambda-ber-schema-specific X-ray fluorescence
```
